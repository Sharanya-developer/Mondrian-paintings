        <h3>About Piet Mondrian</h3>
        <img src="./assets/piet.png">
        <p class="para">Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) was a Dutch painter known for his abstract, geometric works and contributions to the development of modern art.
            He is celebrated for his pivotal role in the 'De Stijl' movement, which emphasized geometric abstraction and simplicity. His work is 
            distinguished by a grid of vertical and horizontal lines and a palette dominated by primary colors—red, blue, yellow—alongside black, white, 
            and gray. Initially influenced by Impressionism and Cubism, Mondrian's mature style evolved into a strict geometric abstraction, most famously
             represented in his "Composition" series. His innovative approach has profoundly influenced design, architecture, and fashion. Mondrian's art was also shaped by his interest in 
             Theosophy, reflecting a quest for universal harmony. His legacy endures, significantly impacting modern art and design.
